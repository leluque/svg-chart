# SVG-Chart
A Java-based library that draws sector charts (like Pie Charts) inside SVG images.

## Motivation
Sometimes, it is interesting to generate sector charts inside images. This approach can convey a different result than traditional pie charts and aggregate value to a report. As an example, a report with the profile of a person could be presented with a chart with a person filled with sections that represents the intensity of different characteristics that form the person's profile (Figure 1).
